# Ford Go Bike Data Exploration

### by Samuel Tumilara Familusi 

The data consists of information regarding 183,000 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data features include duration (secs) and others such as DateTime, customer type, gender, as well as some additional variables.

## Summary of findings 

I observed that the average ride duration is higher on weekends (saturday and sanday), sunday has the highest ride duration, during the other week day the ride duration is very small compared to the weekends. The correlation between distance and duration is also very low.

## Key Insights

1. People spend longer riding on saturdays and sundays 
2. There are more people renting bikes for trips to and from work 
3. There is an even distribution of genders but there are more male riders.
4. There is very little correlation between duration and distance
